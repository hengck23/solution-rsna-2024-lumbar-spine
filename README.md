- Modify the path setting by editing  "/src/third_party/\_dir_setting_.py"

```
# please use the full path 
DATA_KAGGLE_DIR     = '... for downloaded and unzipped Kaggle data ... '
DATA_PROCESSED_DIR  = '... for intermediate processed data ...'
RESULT_DIR          = '... for training output like model weights, training logs, etc ...'
```

## 4. Set Up Dataset

- <DATA_KAGGLE_DIR> contains data from "rsna-2024-lumbar-spine-degenerative-classification.zip" at:  
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2024-lumbar-spine-degenerative-classification/data

- <DATA_PROCESSED_DIR> contains the 3 manually created files from the DATA_PROCESSED_DIR folder in this repo.
    - train_label_coordinates.fix01b.csv: correct annotation for spinal canal stenosis point
    - nfn_sag_t1_mean_shape.512.npy, scs_sag_t2_mean.512.npy: mean reference shape created from
https://www.kaggle.com/code/hengck23/shape-alignment
    - Other processed data can be created by running the python script:
  ```
  python "/src/process-data-01/run_make_data.py"  
  ```
    - A backup copy of all processed data can be found in the google-share drive:
  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jPPxAP6DHGQMHJPUGjPO7_Q5Asrj_LL3?usp=sharing 



## 5. Training the model

### Warning !!! training output will be overwritten to the "<RESULT_DIR>" folder

### NFN (neural foraminal narrowing) models
- Bugged Models:
Due to a bug in the flip augmentation (left-right points not reordered) in training, the submitted model weights are 
not correct. You can reproduce the bugged models by running the following script:
```  
cd src/nfn_trainer_bugged
python run_train_nfn_pvtv2_b4_bugged.py

output model:
- <RESULT_DIR>/one-stage-nfn-bugged/pvt_v2_b4-decoder3d-01/
```  
- Fixed Models: The bug was fixed at the last minute, a day before the deadline. We only managed to retrain and use two model weights (fold2,3 out of 5) 
for submission. To train the corrected models, run:

```  
cd src/nfn_trainer
python run_train_nfn_pvtv2_b4_fixed.py

output model:
- <RESULT_DIR>/one-stage-nfn-fixed/pvt_v2_b4-decoder3d-01/
```  
- Optional Models: These are not used in submission. We use various image backbone encoders like convnext and efficientnet for post-submission
experiments.


```  
cd src/nfn_trainer
python run_train_nfn_covnext_small.py
python run_train_nfn_effnet_b5.py

output model:
- <RESULT_DIR>/one-stage-nfn-fixed/convnext_small-decoder3d-01/
- <RESULT_DIR>/one-stage-nfn-fixed/effnet_b5-decoder3d-01/
```


- Lastly, if you want to ensemble and perform local validation, run the script:

```
cd src/nfn_trainer_bugged
python run_ensemble_and_local_validation.py

cd src/nfn_trainer
python run_ensemble_and_local_validation.py
```  

### SCS (spinal canal stenosis) models

- Optional Models: These are not used in submission as one-stage SCS models did not improve the public lb score when added to the team solution. 
```  
cd src/scs_trainer
python run_train_scs_pvtv2_b4_fixed.py
python run_train_scs_covnext_base.py
python run_train_scs_effnet_b3.py

output model:
- <RESULT_DIR>/one-stage-scs/pvt_v2_b4-decoder2d-01/
- <RESULT_DIR>/one-stage-scs/convnext_base-decoder2d-01/
- <RESULT_DIR>/one-stage-scs/effnet_b4-decoder2d-01/
```
- Similarly, if you want to ensemble and perform local validation, run the script:

```
cd src/scs_trainer
python run_ensemble_and_local_validation.py
```
